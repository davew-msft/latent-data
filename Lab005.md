
Building a custom skill gives you a way to insert transformations unique to your content. A custom skill executes independently, applying whatever enrichment step you require.  It's like a microservice.  

Following our workshop, we are going to create a custom skill to identify and extract disease names from our data and store them as entities in a separate field attached to the document.

Why are we doing this?  

* We can then leverage facets to show the diseases and their counts that are mentioned in the search results
* basic filtering

Remember, these custom skills are just independent code that is called in the context of an Azure Search pipeline (but could of course be called in other ways and other workflows).  

We are going to do this compute with an Azure Function and we are going to leverage pre-built recipes and code from our [Azure Search Power Skills repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-power-skills).  There are a lot of good custom skills here that you may want to consider in your projects including:

* AcronymLinker (provides definitions for known acroynyms)
* CustomEntityLookup (finds custom entity names)
* tokenizer (extracts words from text)

## Process

* Clone Power Skills repo on your workstation
* `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-power-skills.git`
* Open Visual Studio and find the `CustomEntitySearch` project and then WordLinker.cs and then `words.csv`.  
* We are going to place our own dictionary in this file.  You can find this at our [words.csv](./data/words.csv) file.  
* Open `CustomEntityLookup.cs` which is the main code, and familiarize yourself with it. 
  * note the values/parameters you can change 

### Test the function locally

  * "Set as Startup Project" the CustomEntityLookup
  * F5
  * you should see the URL for post calls
  * Open Postman and change the request type from GET to POST
  * For Body enter something like:

```JSON
  {
    "values": [
        {
            "recordId": "1",
            "data":
            {
                "text":  "This is a 53-year-old man with diabetes, morbid obesity, hepatitis C, and cirrhosis."
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The response is in the format that AzSearch expects and will be the basis of the Custom Skill. 

### Deploy the AzFunc

* Right click the project and choose Publish
* follow the prompts
* after deployment open the Azure Portal and find the AzFunc
* Choose `Get Function URL` and copy the full URL
* retest in Postman

## Worst Practices

* We deployed this manually.  Probably not a good idea
* We have `code=` parameters in the azfunc.  It makes development easier
* consumption or an App Service

In the next lab we will add our azfunc code as a custom skill.

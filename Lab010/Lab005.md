## Basic Process

Do each step by following the hyperlink and then come back to here and continue with the next step.  

### Create a labeled dataset
* [create a custom skill](./Lab005-custom-skill.md) to label data for named entity recognition
* create a Azure Search enrichment pipeline that integrates the "label skill" to created labelled data from your documents.  
* put the labeled dataset into the knowledge store so it can be used for training.  

### Train a model
* use the labeled data to train a NER model in AMLS using a BERT model.  [Background on the model can be found here](https://github.com/microsoft/nlp-recipes)
* integrate this custom skill with Azure Search to identify the entities in your existing documents into the search index and knowledge store

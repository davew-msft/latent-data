In the previous lab, we created an index that contained a field called diseases which allowed us to not only search this field, but also facet (categorize documents) and filter documents based on whether they contain specific diseases. One of the challenging things with diseases is they are often really hard to spell. Take the rare disease "mucopolysaccharidosis". You could imagine that when people search for this, they could do a really poor job of spelling it. Perhaps they might type "mukopolisakaridosis". Although search allows you to handle simple spelling mistakes, this is far more than a simple spelling mistake. From a user perspective, it would be incredibly frustrating to get 0 results. Luckily there are ways that we can accommodate this through the use of custom analyzers. Specifically what we will be creating is a "Phonetic" custom analyzer that allows the search engine to match on words that sounds phonetically similar. That would allow users to type "mukopolisakaridosis", yet find matches where the diseases stored is "mucopolysaccharidosis".

You might imagine numerous examples of where phonetic search could help including:

People names (for example Cavanagh vs. Kavanaugh)
Audio Transcription Mistakes (for examples SQL being transcribed as sequel)
Azure Cognitive Search provides various phonetic encoders that will encode words in different ways. The one we will use is called doubleMetaphone and this encodes both mukopolisakaridosis and mucopolysaccharidosis to a code of MKPL. Since it is stored in the index as MKPL, when someone searches for either mukopolisakaridosis or mucopolysaccharidosis, they both get encoded to the same value and as a result you get a match.

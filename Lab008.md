Term Frequency (TF) looks at how often a query term matches in a single document. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) looks at how often a query term matches in many documents (common examples include "is" "or" "the").

In some cases, the ranking of results that Azure Cognitive Search provides by default are not optimal. For example, what if in the past year there have been recent developments in treating the morquio disease so a user wants to search for clinical trials that discuss the "morquio" disease and they are mostly interested in clinical trials that have been updated in the past year? The default ranking of results does not take into account each clinical trial's lastUpdatePosted field.

Luckily you have a lot of control over this in Azure Cognitve Search. One way to handle this scenario might be to order results in descending order by the lastUpdatePosted field since we've made that field Sortable in the index. While sorting by a particular field is useful in some scenarios, this might give us clinical trials at the top of the list that aren't as relevant as results lower down the list even though they were recently updated.

Another way to handle this is to create what is called a [scoring profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/index-add-scoring-profiles). You can have one or more scoring profiles created for a search index and each scoring profiles has a set of weights and functions that can be used to adjust the default scoring (and resulting ordering) of the search results. For our example, we might want to use a scoring profile with the freshness function. By using the freshness function, we can boost the score of clinical trials that have a lastUpdatePosted date within the last year.
